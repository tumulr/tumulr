# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Staff Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience designing and building **scalable distributed systems**. My work spans **microservices, cloud-native platforms, event-driven architectures, and large-scale data processing**.  

Over the years, Iâ€™ve led engineering teams, driven architecture decisions, and delivered resilient platforms powering millions of users. I enjoy solving complex problems, simplifying systems, and mentoring engineers to grow in their craft.  

I use this space to share experiments, prototypes, and ideas as I explore the evolving landscape of distributed systems, cloud technologies, and software development.

ðŸš€ Always curious. Always building.
